# Data Structures

I had never implemented my own data structures before,
so I wanted to take the opportunity given the extra 
indoor hours of the COVID-19 pandemic to whet my curiosity.

## What is this?

A repository of data structures I have implemented for
the experience of it. These data structures haven't been
tested for performance, and some of them are redundant
given built-in language features. I don't intend for people
to use these.

I had initially thought it might be interesting to write
the structures in a variety of languages, and I may 
continue that work one day. For now, it's just JavaScript.

Each subsection has its own Readme as well.
